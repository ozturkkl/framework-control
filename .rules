    - **/node_modules/**

notes:
  - When a feature is added, if needed update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md when adding/altering endpoints, UI components, config, or background tasks. Treat it as required documentation.
  - Use @routes.rs, @main.rs, @App.svelte, and @README.md shorthands in prompts.
  - If a change is made and should be in the changelog, update CHANGELOG.md under "Unreleased" with concise one-line bullets for user-visible changes (features, fixes, behavior changes). Collapse related changes into a single line when possible.
